Game Interface

    Initialization:
        [complete] Welcome screen - prompt user to center face on screen
        [complete] Perform face detection - define face search space
            FIN a) collect N frames
            FIN b) avg rects --> return roi
            c) check that face is not too large/small
        [complete] Screen Calibration - promp user to look at 5 pts to define gaze search space
            a) estimate corners by avg over N frames
            b) initialize linear model for gaze estimation

    Play:
        [incomplete] Perform eye detection - define eye search space and compute eye center
            a) use kalman filter for more accurate center estimation
        [incomplete] Determine gaze - use linear model to map center to gaze
            a) draw gaze within screen boundary
        [incomplete] Check for valid stare
            a) determine and report if gaze is outside stare boundary
            b) determine and report if blink occured (done)
            c) report duration of stare (done)
        [incomplete] Increase difficulty as a function of time
            (outline later)
            ideas: add pop up distractions, shrink or move stare boundary (not if accuracy sucks)



classifier is bad at detecting eyes when looking down, keep face in lower half of image, not too close to screen
